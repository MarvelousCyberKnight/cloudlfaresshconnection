I bought a raspberry pi and i bought a domain also from cloudflare and i decided to connect it to the outside world so that i can ssh into my pi from anywhere anytime in the world so first i obviously created a tunnel that allows connection from my raspberry pi through my domain that i bought and i configured that tunnel to accept ssh connections but before that i had to make sure that my ip address of my raspberry pi has to be static so that in case of any power failure or network issues my ip does not change and i can make that tunnel route permanent and while configuring the tunnel as well i was configured the tunnel through docker and i make sure that it restart always so that it doesn't have to be re connected after a restart and then after successfully configuring the tunnel with a static ip i went to create an application where i have configured a policy to allow ssh connections from the email address that i plan to use for accessing the ssh connection as it requires a otp code to be sent to that particular registered mails for verification and i have added browser rendering to be ssh and vola i have made a connection now i can just go to that address and enter my email and verify myself with the otp i am able to login to my pi but it was a browser version i wanted it to access from my termial so i installed cloduflare in my client machine and i have authenticated my self through cloduflare access cloudflared access ssh-gen --hostname ssh.yourdomain.com just used ssh and my user name @ my domain i was redirected to a web page that verifies with the registered mail and i was able to access my pi through terminal.
